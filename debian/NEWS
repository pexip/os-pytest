pytest (3.0.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  pytest dropped all versioned py.test-X.Y entrypoints. If you need to run a
  test suite with a specific Python version, please use `pythonX.Y -m pytest`
  instead.

  pytest 3.0.0 also started to provide `/usr/bin/pytest` upstream. Since this
  binary is already taken by python-logilab-common, the package does not
  include this entrypoint.
